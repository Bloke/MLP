MLP KNOWN ISSUES
================

* If using the 'Power users can change a rendition's language or article'
feature, if you change a rendition's language or article ID then the 'View'
link will not be updated until you reload the article.

* Older version of MLP sometimes lost track of changes to the textpattern
table made by other plugins such as glz_custom_fields. This manifests
itself when you save a rendition and the changes are reflected in the
admin side but _not_ in the public site. To fix this, find any plugin that
modifies the textpattern table and force it to make a change to the table.
For example, with glz_custom_fields, visit Extensions->Custom Fields and
either change an existing field's type, or create a new field. Make sure
you save the changes and then visit another admin panel which causes MLP
to resync the tables. You can then change your edited custom field back
the way it was, if you wish.
