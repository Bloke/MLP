l10n MLP Pack
Frequently Asked Questions.

================================================================================

Q-001.	zem_contact_lang-mlp is not listed under the MLP>Plugins tab.
A-001.	Make sure that zem_contact_lang-mlp is enabled under the 
	admin>plugins tab. 

================================================================================

Q-002.	Some files are listed as modified in the admin>diagnostics tab.
A-002.	Yes, the MLP Pack is not a pure plugin and does modify some of the TxP 
	core files...
	lib/txplib_db.php (mandatory)
	publish.php (optional)
	The changes in the db layer are required for the MLP Pack to function but the
	changes made in publish.php are only needed in your system if you want to use 
	TxP's previous and next tags in your site.

Q-003.	Sometimes my site seems to 'switch' to another language without me doing
	anything: what could be causing this?
A-003.	This could be due to...
			a) Browser caching.
			b) Not having cookies enabled in your browser for the site.
	Because your browser caches pages by URL and not every URL output from an MLP
	pack site necessarily has the language code embedded in it, the browser may be
	using an 'old' cached version of the page which you previously viewed in 
	another lanugage. You can see if this is the case by simply refreshing the 
	page while bypassing the cache (Shift-refresh in Firefox).

	However, most links output from MLP are now post-processed to insert the lang
	code to stop browsers doing this.

	Alternately, if you have not enabled cookies for the site then the session
	cookie that is used to track your last language choice will be unavailable. 
	If this happens then the site will try to serve the page according to these
	priorities...

		i)	according to the language specified in the url (if any is specified, 
			and if it exists on this site) 

	else

		ii)	serve one of the languages asked for by the browser in its accept-language
			header. (In Firefox go to Preferences > Advanced > General > Languages to
			see the list of headers sent to the site and to edit their priority.)

	else

		iii) serve the page in the site's default language (if possible)

	else

		iv) 404 page error.

================================================================================

Q-004.	How come the text of my articles (renditions) isn't rendering correctly?
A-004.	This is most likely down to the fact that your site has styled the page
	with a font that doesn't support all of the glyphs needed to render your article
	properly, or that such a font isn't present on your system.

		For example, to render polytonic Greek you need a font with an extended set
	of diacritic marks. Your site visitors will need such a font installed on their
	OS and you need to setup your style sheet to reference fonts that contain these
	marks too (unless the visitor has overridden the site styling with their own).

	Alternatively, the encoding of your source file used for the content might not
	be quite correct.

================================================================================

Q-005.	Are there any known problems?
A-005.	Yes. 

	* When on the write tab, switching views (to HTML or Preview) looses track of the 
	language setting.
	* Subdirectory installations are **not** supported.
